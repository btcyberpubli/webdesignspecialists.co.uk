        <h2>Professional Web Design and Development Services</h2>
        <p>Web Design Specialists Ltd. provides comprehensive web solutions from initial concept through launch and ongoing support. Our services are detailed below.</p>

        <div class="service">
            <h3>Responsive Website Design</h3>
            <p>We design and develop websites that function flawlessly across all devices and screen sizes. Responsive design ensures optimal viewing experience whether visitors access your website on desktop computers, tablets, or mobile phones. We follow mobile-first design principles, prioritising mobile experience and progressively enhancing for larger screens. Design layouts are fluid and flexible, adapting to different viewport sizes. Touch interface considerations are incorporated for mobile and tablet devices. All designs comply with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum). Testing across multiple devices and browsers is conducted before project completion. Responsive website design typically requires 8-12 weeks depending on complexity and content volume.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service">
            <h3>Web Application Development</h3>
            <p>For businesses requiring advanced functionality beyond traditional websites, we develop custom web applications. Web applications can include customer portals, project management tools, data management systems, and workflow automation platforms. Development utilises modern frameworks and technologies selected based on specific application requirements. Applications are designed for scalability, allowing growth as business needs expand. We implement robust testing to ensure reliability and performance. Applications include user authentication, data validation, error handling, and comprehensive logging. Ongoing maintenance and updates are available to keep applications current with evolving security standards and technology updates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service">
            <h3>E-Commerce Solutions</h3>
            <p>E-commerce platforms require specialist expertise to succeed. We design and develop online stores optimised for customer acquisition and conversion. Platforms include product catalogue management, shopping cart functionality, secure payment processing, order management, inventory tracking, and customer account management. We select appropriate e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, custom solutions) based on business requirements and scale. Sites are optimised for search visibility, enabling customers to find products. Conversion rate optimisation ensures effective use of visitor traffic. We address payment security, ensuring PCI DSS compliance for card payments. Mobile optimisation is prioritised as significant e-commerce traffic originates from mobile devices. E-commerce projects typically require 10-16 weeks depending on product catalogue size and custom functionality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service">
            <h3>User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) Design</h3>
            <p>Great web design combines visual appeal with intuitive functionality. Our UX/UI specialists conduct user research, develop information architectures, create wireframes, and design interfaces optimised for usability. We follow human-centred design principles, ensuring websites are intuitive and meet user expectations. Usability testing validates designs with real users before development. Navigation is clear and logical, reducing friction for visitors seeking information or completing actions. Interface design is consistent, professional, and reflects brand identity. Interactive elements respond immediately to user input, providing feedback and confirmation. Accessibility is integrated throughout design, ensuring websites are usable by people with various abilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service">
            <h3>Content Management Systems (CMS)</h3>
            <p>We implement and customise content management systems enabling non-technical users to manage website content independently. Popular platforms include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. CMS systems provide intuitive interfaces for creating, editing, publishing, and managing website pages, blog posts, images, and other content. Template systems ensure design consistency across content created by multiple users. User role and permission systems control who can access and modify content. CMS platforms include built-in search engine optimisation features. We provide comprehensive training and documentation to ensure client teams can confidently manage content. Ongoing support is available for CMS updates and user questions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service">
            <h3>Website Performance Optimisation</h3>
            <p>Slow websites lose visitors and reduce conversion rates. We analyse website performance and implement optimisation strategies. Performance improvements include image optimisation, code minification, caching strategies, content delivery network (CDN) implementation, and server configuration optimisation. We use performance measurement tools to identify bottlenecks and track improvements. Optimisation reduces page load times, improving user experience and search engine visibility. Mobile performance receives particular attention as mobile networks may be slower than desktop connections. Performance monitoring continues after launch, identifying and addressing issues proactively.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service">
            <h3>Web Accessibility Compliance</h3>
            <p>Websites should be accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. We design and develop websites to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards as minimum. Accessibility improvements include proper heading hierarchies, alt text for images, keyboard navigation support, colour contrast standards, and semantic HTML markup. Screen reader compatibility is tested. Forms include proper labels and error messages. Accessible websites benefit all users, including those using mobile devices or slow connections. Accessibility compliance also supports search engine visibility, as search engines favour accessible websites. We conduct accessibility audits and remediation for existing websites.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service">
            <h3>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</h3>
            <p>Website visibility in search engines directly impacts business success. We incorporate SEO best practices throughout design and development. Technical SEO includes proper site structure, XML sitemaps, robots.txt configuration, and search engine-friendly URL structures. On-page SEO involves title tags, meta descriptions, heading optimisation, and keyword-rich content. Site architecture supports search engine crawling and indexing. Page speed optimisation improves search visibility. Mobile optimisation is essential, as search engines prioritise mobile-friendly websites. We conduct keyword research to identify search terms relevant to your business. While design and development provide strong SEO foundations, ongoing SEO content and link building typically continue after launch.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service">
            <h3>Website Maintenance and Support</h3>
            <p>Websites require ongoing maintenance to remain secure, functional, and current. We offer maintenance packages including regular updates, security patches, backup management, performance monitoring, content updates, and technical support. Regular updates ensure compatibility with browser updates and operating system changes. Security patches address vulnerabilities in underlying technologies. Backup systems ensure data recovery in case of problems. Website monitoring detects performance issues and broken functionality. Our support team responds to technical issues promptly. Maintenance packages are customised to individual client needs and website complexity.</p>
        </div>
